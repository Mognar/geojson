# geojson

## Project to try and make a map of the UK, broken down into parliamentary constituencies, visualising the number of debates spoken in for each constituency's MP in the 2015 Parliament. 

topojson files used were copied from [martinjc](https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON/tree/master/json/electoral)
d3 code was cribbed from various projects by [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)

### ongoing work
- Getting all the data from 2015-16 and 2016-17 sessions correct
- Combining NI topojson file with GB topojson file
- Adding NI constituency Members' data to mpgeo.csv 

### wish list
- Reponsive map (currently just changing page layout using css, but would ideally like the svg to appear different sizes based on screen size)
- Legend for colours on map
- Table in lower-left corner of page to show additional information about each constituency
